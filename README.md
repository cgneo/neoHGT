## About
**neoHGT** can predict the horizontal/lateral gene transfer (HGT) for species of interest. This project is based on [HGTector](https://github.com/qiyunlab/HGTector) developed by Qiyun lab, but the difference is that I have fixed some known bugs, optimized the downloading process by leveraging multi-processing, and improving the overall stability of the software.

  


## Installation
The project is written in Python3.<br>
Recommended installation method:

Step 1/3:

```
conda create -n neoHGT -c conda-forge python=3 pyyaml pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

Step 2/3:

Next, you will need to manually install diamond by visiting [the official conda webpage](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/diamond/files).

You will see a list of files, please look at the begining of the filename, which describes the operating system. After downloading the one that corresponds to your system, you can run

```
conda install
```

followed by the file you just downloaded (dragging the file to your teminal) to install diamond.

Step 3/3:

Run the following command:

```
conda activate neoHGT
pip install git+https://github.com/neoLIZV/neoHGT.git
```


## Database

Compared to HGTector, neoHGT uses multi-processes to enable parallel downloading, saving you time on the database downloading process. 


## Search

neoHGT added `try` and `except` to make the searching process more robust.

To perform a search, please refer to [HGTector's Search](https://github.com/qiyunlab/HGTector/blob/master/doc/search.md) for more information.

## Analyze

neoHGT changed the output format of the graph from `.png` to `.pdf` for better resolution and publication purposes.

To perform analysis, please refer to [HGTector's Analyze](https://github.com/qiyunlab/HGTector/blob/master/doc/analyze.md) for more information.


## Lastly

To uninstall, you may run:
```
conda remove -n neoHGT --all
conda uninstall bioconda
```

For comprehensive guideline, please refer to [HGTector's Installation](https://github.com/qiyunlab/HGTector/blob/master/doc/install.md) for full information.
